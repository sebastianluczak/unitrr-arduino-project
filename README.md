Simple minds have simple goals.

I need to be able to communicate with unittr instance by using my custom made Arduino Board with display and keys.

- display current running KEY of task from Unittr
- display current running time of task
- steer stop/start task
- be able to choose task by using directional buttons
- custom wiring and 3D printed box (optional)
